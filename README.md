# content-hub
This is a mobile application intended to curate several media content pertaining to the user's interests and mood.

## What does Content Hub do?
This application was created as a solution for a client who expressed frustration with the need to navigate across several social media and entertainment platforms such as
Youtube, Instagram, Spotify to find content that was desireable and could address the boredom brought by the pandemic. This is the issue content-hub aims to solve. Currently, 
it uses the user's personal information: interests, background, mood, amongst others to filter down vidoes and music from Youtube and Spotify respectively and to deliver uplifting 
quotes from the web.
